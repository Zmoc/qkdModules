For example, if unitary operation $U$ acts on a system represented by state $V$, then the new state is given by $V'=U\\cdot V$. However, since $U$ is unitary that means $U^\\dagger U=I$. Therefore, we can multiply both sides with $U^\\dagger$ and get $U^\\dagger V' = U^\\dagger U\\cdot V=V$. In other words, $U^\\dagger$ undoes the action of $U$. \n",
